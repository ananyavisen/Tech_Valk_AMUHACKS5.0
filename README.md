# Personalized First-Semester Survival Guide

 ## Problem Statement
First-semester students often struggle to adapt to college life due to differences in schooling background, confidence levels, and unfamiliar academic expectations. A one-size-fits-all approach fails to support students with diverse needs.

 ## Proposed Solution
This project aims to create a personalized survival guide for first-semester students by understanding their academic background, confidence level, and course structure. Based on this data, the system generates customized guidance, learning resources, and gamified quests to help students transition smoothly into college life.

 ## Core Flow
1. User logs into the platform
2. User completes an onboarding questionnaire
3. The system analyzes responses to build a student persona
4. A personalized dashboard is generated with:
   - Confidence visualization
   - Course-related resources
   - Adaptive quests and guidance

 ## Current Progress
- Login page UI done
- Onboarding questionnaire UI done
- Dashboard UI (in progress)
